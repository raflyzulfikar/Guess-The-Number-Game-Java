# Project - Number Guessing Game
## Project Description
   This project is a simple implementation of the “Guess the Number” game using the Java programming language. The player will be asked to guess a secret number    randomly selected by the program, within the range of 1 to 10. The program will give hints whether the guess is too low, too high, or already correct. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the right number.
## How the Game Works
   1.	The program will randomly select an integer number between 1 and 10 (inclusive). 
   2.	Players will be required to enter their guesses. 
   3.	After each guess, the program will tell whether the player's guess is: 
      - `Too low!` if the guess number is smaller than the secret number. 
      - `Too high! ` if the guessed number is greater than the secret number. 
      - `Congratulations! You guessed the number in X tries!` if the guess is correct. 
   4.	The game will keep repeating until the player successfully guesses the secret number correctly. At the end of the game, the number of tries required will be displayed.
## Example of Display in Console

   1.	Prepare Files
      Make sure the `GameTebakAngka.java` file is inside the `src/` folder inside your project directory.
   2.	Compile Code
      Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project root directory (`your-project-folder-name/`), then compile the Java files:
     	
 	   javac src/GameTebakAngka.java
      
   4.	Run the Program
      Once successfully compiled, you can run the game:
